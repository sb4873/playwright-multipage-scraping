# Scraping with Playwright (multipage)

 In the three workbooks we worked from the bare bones of scraping with BeautifulSoup all the way to using Playwright to scrape multiple pages of a super weird website.

 Things I learnt and would refer back to 'Tow Trucks' for:

 1. Everything Playwright
 2. Multipage scrape using 'next' button or its adjacent
 3. How to ask ChatGPT better questions even when it feels like you are going down a rabbit hole
 4. "Brute Forcing" with text search in BeautifulSoup can often be better than trying to get tags
 5. Need to follow up on what XPATH does and is it superior to CSS for searching text ?
